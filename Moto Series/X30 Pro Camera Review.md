## Intro

**欢迎回来👏（指我自己）**

**X30 Pro的评测因为时间紧张素材不足，最终会以图文的形式呈现。不过我们还是从中整理了有用的素材，想用视频和大家聊一聊X30 Pro在拍照上的表现。**

**作为对比，我拿出了仅有的Pixel 4，更大更先进的传感器能不能打败3年前聪明的算法，请大家拭目以待。**

Welcome back.

It’s been almost half a year since Motorola X30 Pro release, and we finally have time to talk about how it performs on cameras.

For comparison, I got Pixel 4.  To see if a bigger and more advanced sensor can beat the clever algorithm from 4 years ago.

## Main Camara

**第一眼相机的UI布局和操作逻辑几乎就是谷歌相机的翻版，不同的是提供了包括手动模式在内的更多功能。**

At first glance, the UI and the way it operates are just like the Gcam but offering more features, including manual mode.

### Default mode

**X30 Pro的广角主摄使用了三星的ISOCELL HP1传感器，最大特点是两亿像素的分辨率和最大16：1的像素合并功能。**

The Moto's main camera, Samsung's ISOCELL HP1, features 200-megapixel resolution and a maximum 16:1 Pixel Binning feature.

**得益于骁龙8 Plus Gen 1的性能，主摄拍照默认开启像素4合1的5千万像素模式，不过每拍一张照片就要卡上那么一秒，体验不是很好。从这里到之后的所有样片除了个人信息打码，没有经过任何的后期处理。**

Thanks to the performance from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip, turning on the main camera will open the 50-megapixel mode, which will combine 4 pixels into 1. But you'll have to wait for 1second each time you press the shutter. And from now on in this video, we'll just pixelate the personal information on these sample pictures, and that's it. No other photoshop trickery.

**X30 Pro的成像风格偏向写实——色温偏冷，也不会刻意拉高饱和度。在这一组样张里，Pixel的画面较暗，饱和度很高，看起来天色已晚大家都在赶回家吃饭。而实际上当时才刚刚日落，X30 Pro的画面才更接近真实观感，而且展现出了更多的暗部细节。**

Moto's picture style is realistic —— the color temperature is colder, and the saturation is not deliberately high. In this set, the one from Pixel 4 are dark and highly saturated, looks like it's late and folks are rushing home for dinner. In fact, it was just about to get dark.
And the picture from the Moto just look more real and it shows dark details as well.

**但摄影也不是一味的追求写实，这张无反相机的色调倒是更符合我对夏天的向往。**

But photography is not all about realism, and the color tone on this picture, from a mirrorless camera, is more in line with my desire for summer.

**如果你打开了智能高分辨的选项，在特定场景X30 Pro会用主摄拍出一张一亿像素的照片。如果照片周围的信息量够大，看起来会非常震撼。这是一张15MB的图像，在16:9填充屏幕后依然能保持清晰锐利。甚至放大多倍以后还能看清物体的轮廓。不过你很快会发现X30 Pro的一个特点，虽然整体画面锐利，但局部仍然充满涂抹的痕迹，你会在之后的样片中发现同样的问题。**

If you turn on the Intelligent High-Resolution mode, a 100-megapixel photo will be taken by the main camera in certain scenarios. If the amount of details around the picture is large enough, it can look very stunning. This is a 15-megabyte picture, it remains sharp after filling up the screen 16:9, and you can still see the silhouette after zooming in for a lot of times. One of the characteristics of the Moto is that although the overall looks sharp, it is still full of smear marks by the edge of the pixel all over the place, and you'll find the same problem in later samples.

## Ultra-wide

**超广角镜头比较适合拍摄和运动相机类似的第一人称的画面，但是X30 Pro对于镜头畸变的处理过于保守，因为绝大多数的设备会选择牺牲一点边角矫正畸变，不过也有人就是喜欢这种夸张的透视效果，摄影本身就是一种艺术表现的形式嘛。**

Ultra-wide lenses are better suited for shooting first-person pictures, similar to sports cameras. However, the way it deals with lens distortion is way too conservative, as most of the devices will sacrifice a bit of edges to correct distortion. But we also have folks out there who enjoy this kind of exaggerated perspective effect, as photography itself is a form of artistic expression.

## Telephoto

**既然定位是旗舰手机，那一颗长焦镜头必不可少。**

**这组照片展示了同样使用2倍长焦的两部手机面对极限距离时的解析力。X30 Pro可以放大16倍，Pixel只有一半。从画面上看两者半斤八两，并没有什么明显的差距，在这样的极限条件下，能勉强看出这是价值15元的美味肉松就已经算是及格了。不过X30 Pro的长焦镜头没有配备光学防抖，当画面放大到16倍时即便手靠在墙上，画面也在剧烈的抖动。**

This set of photos shows the resolution of the two phones, when it faces extreme distances, with the same 2x telephoto. You can enlarge the image on the Moto 16 times, but it only reaches half of it with the Pixel 4.  There is no obvious difference between the two from the picture, and in such extreme conditions, you can still see this delicious meat floss worth fifteen yuan. And that is a pass. However, the Moto's telephoto lens is not equipped with optical stabilization, so when zoom in to 16x, the image still shakes badly even when you lean against the wall.

**当然，长焦镜头可不仅仅是用来当望远镜使的。虽然手机镜头无法拍出800定的压缩感，但是通过适当的裁切，也可以拍出干净纯洁的画面。**

Of course, the telephoto lens is not only for use as a telescope. Although a cell phone lens cannot produce pictures like Nikon 800D, but with proper cropping, you can still produce a clean and pure looking picture.

## Macro

**超广角镜头也可以拍摄微距照片。但是问题在于，X30 Pro上的三个镜头在对焦上都不尽人意。对焦不但不够准确而且反应极慢，在拍摄微距照片时体验尤为糟糕。前前后后拍摄了5张照片，才能选出一张勉强能看。你也能在后面的对比中看到X30 Pro对焦的表现。**

Ultra-wide lens can also be used to take macro photos. The problem, however, is that all three lenses are awful on focus. It is not only inaccurate but also extremely slow, which is especially bad when taking macro photos. I had to take five photos before I could choose one that was acceptable. You can also see how the Moto performs on focus in the later comparison.

## Portrait

**高定人像模式提供了35，50和85mm三个固定焦段。在手机上，这么小的镜头想拍出和无反相机一样光学虚化的效果是几乎不可能的，所以通常的办法是靠算法算出照片的景深再添加模糊效果。我们在之前也探讨过如何使用手机镜头来预测物体的距离，你可以点击这里观看。这里提供了几组样张，分别来自X30 Pro，Pixel和无反相机。**

The portrait mode offers three fixed focal lengths of 35,50, and 85mm. On a cell phone, it is almost impossible to take a photo with such a small lens and achieve the same optical bokeh effect as in a camera. So, the usual method is to calculate the depth of field of the picture and then add a blurring effect. Here are a few sets of sample images from Moto, Pixel, and a mirrorless camera. 

**第一张照片使用35mm焦段最大光圈怼脸拍摄，能看到在近距离，手机也能表现出出色的背景虚化效果。X30 Pro的图像饱和度稍高，看起来十分讨喜，但在物体边缘能看到不自然的光晕。Pixel的画面更偏向于我的实际观感，在物体边缘的处理非常自然，看不出算法介入的痕迹。而相机拍出的画面是最自然的光学散景，也是所有手机想要通过算法达到的最终效果。**

The first photo was taken at the maximum aperture of 35mm focal length, straight up to the face, and you can see that it shows excellent background bokeh effect at close range.
The Moto has a slightly more saturated picture, but you can see that there's an unnatural halo at the edge of the object. The Pixel's image is more to my liking, and the handling of the edges is very natural and not computational. The camera produces the most natural optical bokeh effect, which is the cell phone's ultimate goal through their algorithms.

**第二张照片使用50mm焦段拍摄，被拍摄对象是一个大平面而且自发光，对于手机的虚化和HDR算法都是不小的挑战。这次X30 Pro的画面要更接近实际观感，而且拍摄出的虚化效果更接近相机的画面。但因为前后对比度相似，显示器的边缘出现了不小的瑕疵。屏幕内的画面虽然更加写实，不过你也能注意到Dock栏有些过曝。Pixel的画面饱和度更高，虚化的方式没有跟随光学规律，显示器边缘也充满瑕疵，但能较好的还原屏幕内元素的亮度和色彩，同时，Pixel在拍摄时记录的景深信息可以帮助后期在相册中调整，我认为这是X30 Pro欠缺的地方。**

The second photo comes with a 50mm focal length, and the subject was a large flat surface and self-illumination, which is quite a challenge to the camera's bokeh effect and HDR algorithms.
This time, the Moto's image is closer to the actual look and feel, and the bokeh effect is closer to the image from the camera. However, because of the similar contrast, there's a bit of imperfection on the edge of the display. The graphics are more realistic, but you can also notice the Dock bar is a bit overexposed. The Pixel's frame is more saturated but the bokeh effect does not follow the optical laws, and the edges of the display are full of blemishes. But it can better restore the brightness and color of the elements on the screen. The Pixel can record the depth of field while taking a picture, and it could be helpful for you to adjust it later in the album. This is where the Moto falls short.

**第三张照片同样使用50mm焦段，对于算法是地狱级的挑战。X30 Pro的色温偏暖，而实际上头顶有一盏冷色光源，相比之下Pixel更好的校准了白平衡，而相机完美的还原了颜色。两台设备都丢失了一些细节，就不做评价了。处理复杂场景对于手机来说还为时过早，我们还是看看远处的雪山吧。**

The third shot, also using a 50mm focal length, was a hell of a challenge for the algorithm. The Moto's color temperature is warm, while there is a cold light source overhead.
In contrast, the Pixel is better calibrated for white balance, and the camera reproduces the color perfectly. Both devices are missing details. It is still too early for handsets to handle complex scenes.  Now, let’s take a look at something else.

**第四张照片使用85mm焦段拍摄。这个焦段的拍摄很难对上焦，而且拍摄的画面有些过曝，损失了一些亮度信息。Pixel的两倍长焦拍出的画面看起来完全没有虚化效果，但在相册中拉高深度滑条就可以制造和相机类似的效果。**

The fourth photograph was taken with an 85mm focal length. It was difficult to focus, and the frame was a bit overexposed, losing some brightness information. The frame from the Pixel, on telephoto with a 2x zoom, appears to have no bokeh effect at all, but pulling the slider in the album can create a similar effect to the camera.

**X30 Pro在人像模式的处理上很难说是出色。更大更先进的传感器在解析力上不如超分辨率算法，同时扣像算法对于物体边缘的检测也不够优秀，经常过曝或出现奇怪的模糊。**

The Moto is not that good when it comes to the handling of portrait mode. The larger and more advanced sensors, in terms of analytical power, are not as powerful as the super-resolution algorithms, and the image-snapping algorithm is not good enough to catch the edges of objects. Which, very often, leads to giving them strange blurs.

**在不少场景都能发现X30 Pro错误的估计了物体的距离，而产生了奇怪的画面。也希望在未来的更新里官方能改善这个问题。**

There are many occasions where you can find the Moto incorrectly estimates the distance of the thingy and creates a bizarre picture. Let’s just hope they can fix it in the future update.

## 200M

**你可能会注意到X30 Pro的成像非常明亮，这是因为大底+多合一像素可以获得更多的进光量，大多数时候是好事，也有时侯是坏事。**

You may notice that the pictures from the Moto are very bright, and that's because of the bigger sensor + pixel binning, equals more light intake.

**三星的HP1传感器从发布到现在也有快一年时间了，X30 Pro是第一个用上这个传感器的机器。HP1的最大特点之一是拥有目前手机CMOS最高的两亿像素，在光线充足的情况下能拍出一张解析力非常高的照片。这一组照片展示了原生两亿像素和1200万像素+超分辨率算法的对比。**

It has been almost a year since the release of HP1 sensor, and the Moto is the first phone that features it. One of the most prominent features of the HP1 is that it comes with two hundred megapixels, the highest of any cell phone CMOS to date, which allows it to take a photo with extremely high resolution in good light condition. This set of photographs shows the contrast between the original 200 megapixels and 12 mega + super-resolution algorithm.  

**X30 Pro的照片非常明亮，局部放大能看出轻微的涂抹，但没有锯齿感。Pixel通过超分算法也达到了类似的效果，但放大后画面充满了锯齿。X30 Pro虽然更亮，分辨率更高，但也丢失了不少物体表面的纹理。再去看一看美味肉松，说实话，这张35MB的图片并没有让我觉得比Pixel的3.5MB好上十倍。**

Photos from the Moto are very bright, but if you just zoom in, you can see slight smearing in places. The Pixel can achieve a similar effect by super-resolution algorithm, but if you zoom in, you'll see aliasing anywhere. The picture from the Moto is brighter and has a higher resolution, but it also loses a lot of texture on the surface. Let’s look at that tasty meat floss again, I’m being honest, I don’t think this picture is ten times better than that one from the Pixel.

**那在室外良好的光照下表现如何呢？**

And how does it perform under well-lit outdoors?

**必须承认，HP1的两亿像素的解析力优势被发挥的淋漓尽致。远处大楼外墙上每一块玻璃的轮廓都清晰可见。再放大一些甚至能看到路人手机屏幕上的大致构图。可惜的是，X30 Pro的优势也仅限于此，与解析力相比，色彩只能说是不尽人意。缺少了HDR算法的加持，亮部的天空已经几乎没有细节可言了。整体的色彩风格偏向写实，并没有像其他旗舰机一样自动套滤镜得到浓艳饱和的成片。高情商：还原真实。低情商：发朋友圈没人点赞。**

The advantage of the image resolution of the HP1 sensor, is used to the fullest. The outline of every glass on that building way over there is clearly visible. If you zoom in a little more, you can even see what is on the passerby's phone. Unfortunately, this is where Moto's happy story ends. Compared with the resolution power, the color is quite subpar. Without the HDR algorithm, the bright bit of the sky is almost devoid of detail. The overall style is realistic and does not have the same automatic filtering that other flagships have so that your picture can have a rich, saturated finish. A kind way to say this would be,” That’s just the way it should look like. If you are being terribly honest, “Ain’t nobody is gonna like your post.

**而且两亿像素拍摄隐藏在“更多”选项卡里，更像是个附属功能，而像素合并和大底才是主要卖点。**

Plus, the 200-megapixel is hidden in the "More" tab, which feels like it is more of an accessory feature. While the pixel binning are the primary.

## Night sight

**这就不得不谈到HP1的另外一个特点，在夜晚，可以将16个像素合并成一个单位像素间距2.5微米的大像素。如此大的单位面积可以拍出明亮干净的夜景画面。在这几组照片中，X30 Pro只需要一秒钟左右就能完成画面曝光，而Pixel通常需要等待5秒以上。**

This brings us to another feature of the HP1, at night, it allows 16 pixels to be combined into a single one. And the inter-pixel distance comes to 2.5 microns. With such a huge pixel pitch, you can create bright, and clear night images. In these sets, the Moto takes only about a second to expose the frame, with the Pixel, normally you need to wait for more than 5seconds.

**第一组照片模拟了夜晚拍摄会遇到的大光比情况，两者对于灯带处高光的压制不相上下，远处的暗部细节也都得以保留。其中X30 Pro的画面整体明亮，但远景有轻微涂抹和噪点。Pixel的画面看起来很赛博朋克，远景和暗部噪点较少但看起来很糊。大家更喜欢哪一种风格呢？**

The first set of photographs simulates the huge lighting ratio that you could encounter when you are taking pictures at night, and the two are quite the same in their ability to suppress the highlights from the light strips. And the dark details in the distance are also preserved. The picture from the Moto is bright overall, but slightly blurry and noise in the distance, and the one from the Pixel looks very cyberpunk, with less noise in the distance and dark areas. Which one do you guys prefer?

**如何处理好玻璃反射和之后的物体也是一个难题。第二组照片中，X30 Pro更加侧重于反射景物的成像，而且曝光时间短，树叶的阴影，灯牌的文字都很清晰。Pixel通过长曝光更好的平衡了室内外景物的关系，还能在玻璃上看到我自己的反射，但因为时间长和手抖，画面，影子和灯牌的文字都很糊。**

It is also quite a challenge to deal with the glass reflection and the object behind it. In the second set of photos, the Moto focuses more on reflective scenery with short times of exposure, as the shadows of the leaves and the letters on the sign are all clear. The Pixel, with prolonged exposure, has a better balance between indoor and outdoor scenes, and I can see my reflection in the glass. But because it takes a bit of time and my hand was shaken, the frame, shadows, and the text on the sign are all blurred.

**最后一组照片拍摄于极限暗光环境，Pixel曝光花了接近10秒，而X30 Pro依旧是一秒钟。长时间的曝光导致画面不可避免的变糊，这是算法也补救不了的，相比起来X30 Pro的画面看起来更加清晰，轮胎和地面阴影处的细节也比Pixel要更加丰富。**

The last one was taken in extremely low light, the Pixel taking nearly 10seconds to expose while the Moto, like before, still a second. The prolonged exposure leads to inevitable blurring of the frame, no algorithm is going to save that. In contrast, the Moto's picture looks sharper, compared with the Pixel, there are more details in the tires and the shadows on the ground. 

**在夜景方面X30 Pro采用的是与Pixel完全不同的思路，大底+大像素的进光量非常夸张，只用一秒就能干完别人十秒干的活，而且很多时候还表现的更好。不过奇怪的是，尽管X30 Pro的画面第一眼锐利无比，然而放大后却是Pixel更为清晰。在手动模式下，主摄的最长快门为32s，我更希望在夜景模式下X30 Pro能用更长一些的曝光时间通过算法来抵消噪点和涂抹感。**
The Moto uses a completely different approach to night scenes than the Pixel, with big sensor and large pixel, the amount of light intake is impressive, so it can do things in just one second, and in many cases performs better.
Oddly enough, though, Moto's image is incredibly sharp. But if you zoom in, the Pixel is clearer. In manual mode, the maximum shutter time for the main camera is 32s, but I sure would hope the Moto has a longer exposure time in night mode to algorithmically offset noise and blurry pixel edges.

## Let’s wrap things up

**总的来说，X30 Pro凭借着这块两亿像素的传感器，用更少的算法干预达到了与友商的计算摄影旗舰相近的效果。这种与市场主流旗舰背道而驰的做法，既有惊喜，也有遗憾。一方面，碾压性的像素数量优势换来了更高的解析力，较少的算法干预让X30 Pro的照片更加写实，不太容易产生明显的“塑料感”，即使是夜景拍摄也不需要等待动辄5秒的长曝光。另一方面，即使是8 Plus Gen 1也难以应对如此庞大的像素数量，让人不得不忍受每次按下快门后的一秒卡顿。**

Overall, the X30 Pro, with 200-megapixel sensor, uses fewer algorithmic interventions to achieve results comparable to those of its counterpart's computational photography flagships.
This sort of going a unique way from the mainstream flagship models in the market is both a surprise and a regret. On the one hand, the huge amount of pixels results in higher resolution and fewer computational interventions so that your photos are more realistic and less likely to have that obvious "plastic" feel. And even for night shots, you don't need to wait as long as five seconds for long exposures. On the other hand, even a chip as powerful as the 8 Plus Gen 1 has difficulty coping with such many pixels that you have to wait for one second lag after each press of the shutter.

**作为一台优点和缺点都如此突出的手机，这一次和Pixel的对比，Moto X30 Pro想要对标的不只是三年前的手机和传感器，还有已经沉淀了几十年的算法。**

With such outstanding strengths and weaknesses, setting the Pixel as the rival this time, the Moto X30 Pro wants to benchmark against not only a three-year-old cell phone, but also an algorithm that has been in place for decades.

**虽然X30 Pro提供了两亿像素和手动模式，但对于手机摄影来说，大多数时候一亿和两亿像素只是扫码和高清扫码的区别，手机的优势就在于让一个“聪明的机器”帮助没有摄影知识的普通人得到一张优秀的照片，能够捕捉到生活中转瞬即逝的瞬间才是大多数人的需求。也许在算力充足的未来，手机真的可以只靠一颗几亿像素的超广角“超级主摄”，在算法的加持下实现目前三颗甚至四颗摄像头才能完成的任务。所以计算摄影和高解析力并没有孰优孰劣，它们都不过是在目前的技术限制下的两种无奈之举。**

Although the Moto offers 200-megapixel and a manual mode, for mobile photography, most of the time,100 mega and 200 mega pixels are just the difference between scanning a QR code or scanning it a bit clearer.

The advantage of a cell phone is that there's a "smart machine" that helps ordinary people with no knowledge of photography to get excellent photos. After all, it is the ability to capture that blink of an eye is that most people need.

Perhaps in the future, with ample computing power, cell phones will be able to rely on a "super-primary" camera, and with the aid of an algorithm, it could achieve what only three or even four cameras could do right now.
So, there is no better or worse between computational photography and high-resolution power.
They are just both unavoidable under the limits of the technology available today.

**照片是一件艺术品，拍照就是创作艺术的过程。在过去的几十年里，传感器硬件的进步和计算摄影的流行让移动摄影发生了翻天覆地的变化。你手中的设备比过去的任何时候都更加出色，它们不仅善于处理各种拍摄场景，还能准确的预测你的拍摄意图，选择最合适的成像风格。以前使用相机才能拍出的人像长焦和夜景画面，已经在手机上通过更快的芯片和聪明的算法实现。但不论你在使用相机，手机还是画笔，艺术的表达，最终都将由人来完成。不同硬件规格，不同厂商的调教，意味着不同的艺术风格而不是好坏优劣。虽然，厂商之间的军备竞赛很容易把用户也带入其中，但是，再忙，也不要忘了记录生活中转瞬的美好。**

A photograph is a work of art, and taking pictures is the process of creating art.  Over the past decade, advances in sensor hardware and the popularization of computational photography have created a sea change in mobile photography. The gadget in your hands is more advanced than ever before. They are not only good at handling various shooting scenarios, but they can also accurately predict your intentions and choosing the most appropriate filter. The telephoto, portraits, and night mode that were only possible with cameras in the old days are now available on your phones, with faster chips and clever algorithms.
But no matter if you are using a camera, phone or even a paintbrush, the expression of art, has to be done by men.  Different hardware specifications, and different factory tuning, only mean assorted styles, beyond black and white. Although it is easy to get users involved in the competition among factories. But no matter how busy you are, let's try not to forget to record these tiny moments of beauty in your life.

**祝愿大家都能享受到摄影，带来的乐趣。**

I hope you all get to enjoy the joy of photographing.
